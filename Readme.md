### 2. **Word Prediction**  
- Real-time next-word prediction using an AI model.  
- Suggestion bar with contextually relevant predictions.  

### 3. **Customization**  
- Font selection for personalization.  
- Light and Dark modes for better readability and comfort.  

### 4. **File Export**

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.  
- Required Python libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install tensorflow numpy regex python-docx  
  ```  

### Steps to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  

2. Place the pre-trained model (`Next_Word_Prediction_with_Deep_Learning_in_NLP.keras`) in the project folder.  

3. Launch the editor:  

## How It Works  
- **Real-time Prediction**: Start typing in the editor, and suggested next words will appear in a suggestion bar. Press `Tab` to auto-complete a suggestion.  
- **Rich Text Editing**: Use the toolbar for text styling and case transformations.  
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes as per your preference.  

## Training the AI Model  
The word prediction feature is powered by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The training script is included in the repository for users who want to retrain or fine-tune the model with their own datasets.
